- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryan-vanostrand
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything. I've enjoyed my coding experience and am looking for ways to continue learning new languages and their applications in every aspect of coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of web development and attempting to learn data science in my free time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, if you have a project that inspires you and for some reason want me involved hit me up.
- 📫 How to reach me. You could email me at ryanvanostrand12@gmail.com! Shameless insta plug - @ryan.van.ostrand. Also, if I ever get the desire to stream again, my Twitch.tv is ImSorrySupport.
